# Great Learning Hackathon - Mutual Funds Prediction

The goal of this hackathon is to predict GreatStoneâ€™s
rating of a mutual fund. In order to help investors decide
on which mutual fund to pick for an investment, the task is
to build a model that can predict the rating of a mutual
fund. The various attributes that define a mutual fund can
be used for building the model.
